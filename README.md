Note Well from Elliot Tanzer: Though this formula is for attracting a new romance, that just because someone professes
their undying love for you, you may still have to show some discernment as to whom you choose to let
into your life. With that in mind, remember to clarify what you are wishing for in a future mate. That is, if
you have unresolved relationship issues, you will attract a relationship that reflects those issues.
Therefore, it may be beneficial to make a list of what kind of a person you want to attract. Remember, in
making this list, you are not making a ‘ shopping list’ looking for Mr. or Mrs. Perfect, but a visualization list of a person, just like you, who is growing and evolving, and who is taking responsibility for their
issues, just as you are willing to take responsibility for yours.
Remember, you will get what you ask for, and if what you ask for has fuzzy edges around it, you will get
what you ask for with those fuzzy edges. So do your self examination. Refine your list. And then, place
your vase with fresh flowers and watch what happens.

My prayers are with you for a happy, harmonious and passionately wonderful outcome.
