<h4>Instructions:</h4>
</br>
Place your budding flowers in the vase, in the quadrant of your home that corresponds to the compass degree range given. (Most smart phones have a compass app.) You should attract a strong relationship (romantic or friendly, depending on your intentions).
</br>
</br>
<h5>Note Well:</h5>
If you choose to use this Peach Blossom Feng Shui cure to attract a new romance, keep in mind that if you have unresolved relationship issues, those will still be reflected in any new relationship you attract until those issues are resolved.
Let this not be a deterrent, but instead an opportunity for personal growth and an invitation to choose what kind of energy (and partner) you are inviting into your life.
